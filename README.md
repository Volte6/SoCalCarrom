# SoCalCarrom

Design files for reproducing old socal parks and rec carrom games

================================================================================
|--------------------------/     Carrom Boards     /---------------------------|
================================================================================

To Do:
- Fix black CMYK/RGB issue on Galactic board (maybe convert pshops to CMYK?)
- Build Dungeons & Dragons inspired board if can get high-res image of board

File Notes
- frame layer will give a better idea of what will be hidden under 3/4" rabbet joint
- bottom layer is photo(s) of original board to compare against
- 1.5" Clearance marker can be moved around to test gaps to allow 1" carrom to pass
- All copies of the Roberta font I could find online were broken, so I repaired it




Golf
================================================================================
- 34" x 50"
- 1.5" frame				3/4" overlap with board, hard wood
- 0.5" x 0.5" rails			Maple
- Color					CMYK

- Font - Roberta				Logo, Tees, Sand Traps
- Font - Denne's Old Handwriting		Lakes
- Font - Brush Script			Tee numbers, hole numbers
- Font - (alt for Denne's)		All Things Pink, CF School Handwriting

- Stroke around holes numbers = 7 pt
- Stroke for Guides 36 pt = 0.5"

- Changes from original
  - Shifted hole 6 away from river so wood doesn't overlap
  - replaced Trees (photos not high enough res to get them all)
  - replaced light green with clear (expecting print material to be Birch wood)
  - replaced sand texture
  - Several font substitutions, however retained Roberta for Logo




Galactic Shootout (beta)
================================================================================
- 34" x 50"
- 1.5" frame			3/4" overlap with board, hard wood
- 0.5" x 0.5" rails		Maple
- Color				Spot: Red, Yellow, White

- Font - Roberta			Logo
- Font - Franklin Gothic		ANAHEIM, CALIF.

- Orbits				Stroke 10, convert to object, stroke 7
- Orbits (yellow)		8.5 x 4.75, +/- 26 degrees
- Orbits (red)			8.25 x 4.75, +/- 60 degrees

Astronomy
- Planets			Jupiter, Saturn, Mars
- Inner (yellow)			M104, M51, M13 (?), NGC 1300 (?)
- Outer Top (white)		?, ? (galaxy), comet
- Outer Bottom (white)		? (nebula), ? (galaxies?), M16
- Outer Sides (white)		comet, Milkey Way, ? (round)

- Changes from Original
  - Could not determine some imagery, took best guess or substituted something in the same spirit
  - Swapped one yellow orbit overlap for design simplicity

Notes: since I couldn't identify several of the images, several substitutions for the astronomy photos were made.  I also replaced M16 which I could identify but couldn't gracefully process to work with the other low-detail images.  I consider this board to be beta since there are color issues with the black blend and so many images don't match.  I think my art looks fine, but for authenticity, I'd prefer to match them if I could.  Most of the high-res imagery in this file is linked from seperate files.  Together, it comes to nearly 100 MB, quite a bit bigger than the others.




Maze (Original Version)
================================================================================
- 44" x 44"
- 1.5" frame			3/4" overlap with board, hard wood
- 0.5" x 0.5" rails		Maple
- Color				Spot: Red, Green, White, Black
- Font - Roberta			Logo
- Font - Franklin Gothic		ANAHEIM, CALIF.
- Font - Celtic Garmond the 2nd	all other text (substituted over Superclarendon)
- Font - Superclarendon		"MAZE BOARD GAME" (this was original game font for all text)

- Arrows: Head 3, Tail 20

- Changes from Original
  - minor adjustments to improve symmetry especially the the coridors in and out of "Back to A"

Notes: this is a fairly close match to the original (though not the prototype) maze, but I did tend to even things out a bit so that, for instance, the coridor going into "Back to A" is the same width as the coridor coming out of it.  Checkpoints are mostly centered in their coridors, too.  Other than that, I tended to match the "Dungeons & Dragons" style board since this is the one I remember as a kid.  Unfortunately, I don't have a high enough resolution image of the board to recreate the art, so this file remains the standard red/green maze board.  In the spirit of the D&D variant, I did swap in a more medieval-looking font only because I thought it looks cool.  If anyone could get me a directly overhead, high res shot of the D&D board, I'd love to make that variant, too.

Sept 2021 revision
- resized from 45" to proper 44" (artboard is 42.5" assuming 1.5" thick frame with 3/4" rabbet)
- frame, photos, and 1.5" test marker now hidden (they should not be visible for printing)
- increased size of checkpoints to 1 3/8" to more closely match prototype
- moved lettering for checkpoints onto checkpoint
- Moved positions of some checkpoints to better match original, especially first Trap Door.




Game Rules
================================================================================

Golf: Start on First Tee.  Land carrom inside each hole.  Must be completely in green area of hole.  Once in a hole, continue on same turn, place carrom on Tee and shoot for next hole.  Water and sand--if more than halfway in.  May cross over water and sand so long as you don't land in it.  Take turns shooting, whoever finishes hole 9 first wins.

Galactic Shootout: Presumably knock eachother's carroms out of the middle.  Last man with carroms still in the middle wins.  Or, Two players, each starts on corner comet,  place neutral carroms in center and keep count of those you knock out.

Maze: Start at start line, go to 1, 2, 3, 4, then enter maze.  Whoever reaches end first wins.  If touching red, go back.  Must be completely in green to move forward.  Once you're in the maze, no shooting backward (though bouncing off a wall backward is ok).




Construction Notes
================================================================================

Cut rails to fit, glue to board, then pop-rivet

https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=aOBl-czx7kE
http://diycarromboard.blogspot.com/

  Cut, dowel pins, sand(!), clean with mineral spirits, apply finish/water sealant

  Frame - walnut/maple

  play surface - 1/2" plywood
    Wide Format UV LED Printer to print design (from illustrator)
    Multiple layers (8!) of epoxy to protect
    sand it to remove a tiny bit of the smoothness
    polyurethane final coat

Another user (https://www.instructables.com/id/Carrom-Board/)
  sand plywood with 220
  stain
  hand-draw with pencil, then sharpie
  3 coats polyurethane clear coat, with 220 sanding in between coats

Print: will need to lay down layer of white for colors to print on top of
- create white version, then create color version
- don't forget to remove or shrink guides
- Board: Finishing Grade Plywood (Birch) (originally 1/4" Oil Tempered Masonite)
- Frame: Walnut or Hard Maple
- Rails: 1/2" Maple strips
- corner braces
- UV Print, polyurethane coat

- carroms are 3/8" thick, 1" diameter, small 1/8" hole.  concave for less surface contact
  - hole could probably be used to verify if in/out of bounds
